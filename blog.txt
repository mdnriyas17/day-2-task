difference between document and window

                              DOCUMENT

In the context of web development, "document" refers to the content of a web page,
which is usually written in HTML and displayed in a web browser. The document object represents the content of the web page, and can be manipulated using 
JavaScript to change the content and appearance of the page.


                              WINDOW

"Window" refers to the browser window in which a web page is displayed. 
The window object is a top-level object in JavaScript and represents the browser window. 
It provides access to the properties and methods of the browser window, such as the size of the window, the position of the window, 
and the ability to open and close windows.

In short, the "document" represents the content of a web page, 
while the "window" represents the browser window in which the web page is displayed. 
Both are important concepts in web development and play a crucial role in creating interactive and dynamic web pages.
